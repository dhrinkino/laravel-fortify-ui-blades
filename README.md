# Debloated Laravel UI blades for Fortify

Since Laravel Fortify doesn't provide a pre-made blades for login,register and other actions. I decided to debload Laravel UI Bootstrap Auth blades to plain HTML without any bootstrap classes.

# Installation
Clone repository and move files to resources/views, then feel free to edit blades.
